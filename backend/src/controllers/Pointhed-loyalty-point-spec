Pointhed Loyalty Points Specification (v1)

1. Core Principles
	•	Earn rate and burn rate are independent
	•	Earn rate is global and fixed
	•	Burn rate is vendor-configurable
	•	Points are always integers
	•	Currency rounding happens at redemption, not earning

⸻

2. Supported Currencies
	•	GBP
	•	USD
	•	EUR
	•	NGN

3. Earn Rate (Fixed, Non-Configurable)

Earn Units
Currency    Earn Unit    Definition
GBP         1            £1 = 1 point
USD         1            $1 = 1 point
EUR         1            €1 = 1 point
NGN         1000         ₦1000 = 1 point

Earn Formula
points_earned = floor(transaction_amount / earn_unit)

Examples
	•	£27.99 → 27 points
	•	$10.50 → 10 points
	•	₦9,500 → 9 points
⚠️ No decimals. No rounding up.

4. Burn Rate (Vendor-Configurable)

Definition

Burn rate defines the monetary value of one point.

Burn Rate Constraints
	•	Minimum: 0.01 (1%)
	•	Maximum: configurable (recommended cap: 0.05 / 5%)
	•	Default: 0.01

Point Value Formula
point_value = earn_unit × burn_rate

Examples (1% burn rate)
    •	GBP: 1 point = £0.01
    •	USD: 1 point = $0.01
    •	EUR: 1 point = €0.01
    •	NGN: 1 point = ₦10

Examples (2% burn rate)
    •	GBP: 1 point = £0.02
    •	USD: 1 point = $0.02
    •	EUR: 1 point = €0.02
    •	NGN: 1 point = ₦20


5. Reward Redemption Logic

Reward Monetary Value
reward_value = points_redeemed × point_value

Points Required for Target Reward
points_required = ceil(target_reward_value / point_value)

Examples

NGN (1% burn rate)
	•	Target reward: ₦1,000
	•	Point value: ₦10
	•	Points required: 100

GBP (1% burn rate)
	•	Target reward: £10
	•	Point value: £0.01
	•	Points required: 1000


6. Vendor Generosity Rules
	•	Vendor generosity only affects burn rate
	•	Earn rate must never change
	•	Existing points automatically gain higher value if burn rate increases
	•	Burn rate changes apply prospectively (recommended)

⸻

7. Points Balance Rules
	•	Points balance is stored as integer
	•	Negative balances are not allowed
	•	Points deduction must be atomic
	•	Redemption fails if balance < points_required

⸻

8. Rounding Rules
	•	Earning: floor
	•	Redemption target: ceil
	•	Display values: round to currency minor units (e.g. 2dp for GBP)

9. Example End-to-End Flow

Vendor settings
	•	Currency: NGN
	•	Burn rate: 1%

Transaction
	•	Spend: ₦100,000
	•	Earned: 100 pts

Redemption
	•	Reward: ₦1,000
	•	Required: 100 pts
	•	Balance after: balance - 100

10. Prohibited Logic (Hard Rules)

❌ Earn rate must NOT depend on burn rate
❌ Burn rate must NOT affect points earned
❌ Percentages must NOT be shown to customers
❌ Currency conversion must NOT occur inside points logic



Introduce Minimum Redeemable Value (MRV)

This is currency-based, not points-based.

Recommended defaults ( tested patterns)

Currency    Minimum Reward Value
GBP         £5
USD         $5
EUR         €5
NGN         ₦500

reward_value >= minimum_reward_value

Example (NGN, 1% burn rate)
	•	Point value = ₦10
	•	Minimum reward = ₦500
	•	Minimum points required:
    ceil(500 / 10) = 50 points

Customer cannot redeem anything below 50 points.



Minimum Reward Value
	•	Each currency has a platform-defined minimum redeemable value
	•	Rewards must meet or exceed this value to be redeemable
	•	Vendors may increase but not reduce this minimum
	•	The rule applies only to redemptions, not point grants



Welcome bonus defaults
    •	GBP: 10 point
    •	USD: 10 point
    •	EUR: 10 point
    •	NGN: 10 point
